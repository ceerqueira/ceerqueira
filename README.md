<h5>A little bit about me... üôçüèª </h5>

I was born in Bel√©m do Par√°, at the age of 18 moved to Pato Branco - PR, where I started my computer engineering degree, and at the same time I joined a Junior Company and participated of MEJ (Movimento Empresa Junior), attending events and traveling around Brazil.
After reaching the 5th period of the course I decided to quit.
Then at the age of 23 I decided to move to the European continent, knowing more than 8 countries, among them: Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia and Greece. This allowed me to get to know many people, other ways of seeing the world, and to develop my Spanish and English.
After 3 years I returned to Brazil.

Now I'm back to my studies in the course of Analysis and Development of Systemsüìö and I'm looking for a job in the area of Web development.
